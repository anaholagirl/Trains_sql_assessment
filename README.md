#Trains

##sql assessment for Epicodus

##Created by Linda Gibson

##This program will allow a train station staff to add trains and stations to a system.  Stations can be added as stops to the different train lines and train lines can be added to the different stations.  A passenger may all of this information as well as all the trains and stations in the system.

##This is a work in progress and has a few bugs at this time.  When viewing lines an stations, they sometimes duplicate.  Also, the ability to remove and edit trains and stations has not fully been added yet.  It is in the specs but not usable in the user interface.
